## 🌟 About Me
- 🤖 I design and evaluate **machine learning systems** — from **LLM robustness pipelines** to **probabilistic risk modeling frameworks**.  
- 🛠️ Experienced in building **end-to-end AI workflows** with PyTorch, Hugging Face, DuckDB/HDF5, and HPC orchestration.  
- 🔬 My doctoral work combined **multi-terabyte HPC pipelines** (SLURM, DuckDB, HDF5) with **data-driven simulation** to advance earthquake engineering.  
- 🌍 Passionate about bridging **AI research and real-world impact**, with a focus on systems that are **robust, interpretable, and scalable**.  
- 🚦 Following the frontiers of **agents, reinforcement learning, and reasoning systems** — and exploring how these can power scientific discovery and decision-making.
